# min-height-bst

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers,
  constructs a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST.
  
  The function should minimize the height of the BST.
  You've been provided with a BST  class that you'll have to use to
  construct the BST. Each BST node has an integer value, a left  child node, and a right  child node. A node is
  said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value  is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST  nodes themselves or None / null.
  A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes.
  Note that the BST class already has an insert method which you can use if you want.
